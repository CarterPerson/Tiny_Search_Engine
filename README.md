To build, enter crawler, indexer, and querier and run `make` in each of them.

To clean up, run `make clean` in each of the above directories

To use, run crawler, providing it with the necessary inputs. Then run indexer on the output directory from crawler, along with a filename that you would like to be used for the output file. Finally, you can perform a search on all the webpages found by the crawler function using the query method. See directories' ReadMe files for more info
